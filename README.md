# Dotfiles
I am currently still trying to make the installation of the dotfiles as automatic as possible (real plug-and-play).

## Plug-and-play integration
* The installation of gitAutomator into the path should still be automated.

## Installation
`make` will link the local dotfiles repository to `$HOME`. Any changes in the local repository will be automatically reflected in the proper config files.
